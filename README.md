# archscript
A summer project to make a script to install arch linux. Inspired by https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus

Download the Arch iso file: https://archlinux.org/download/ <br>
Boot and then write:

`pacman -Sy git` <br>
`git clone https://github.com/Tuchdov/archscript.git` <br>
`cd archscript` <br>
`./archtitus.sh`
